Also, I would like to understand the connections between these entities in relation to a particular outcome. Looking at this problem, I can't help but notice it's similarity to a typical Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and am wondering if/how I can bake some of the theory there into my model.\\nLet me explain f...   \n",
